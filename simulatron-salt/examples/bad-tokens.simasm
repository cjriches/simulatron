This is _really_ wrong for a *.simasm file. There are all sorts of incorrect tokens, generating lots of errors.

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /* Don't you love this comment style? */
    printf("Hello, World!");
}

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"  -- We're writing Haskell, right?

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello, world!")  # Say hello.

// The next bit is almost correct!
const YEET (42)
